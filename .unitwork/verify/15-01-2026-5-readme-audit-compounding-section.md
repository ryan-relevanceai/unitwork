# Checkpoint: Add How Unit Work Compounds section

## Verification Strategy
Review for conceptual clarity and non-duplication with Hindsight Integration section

## Subagents Launched
None required - documentation verification

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
- [x] Section placed after Philosophy, before Workflow - Confirmed
- [x] Explains what "compounding" means - Confirmed via ASCII diagram showing learning flow
- [x] Shows connection between phases and learning - Confirmed:
  - Bootstrap → codebase patterns
  - Plan → planning learnings
  - Work → gotchas
  - Review → review patterns
  - Compound → feature learnings
- [x] Explains how Memory Recall starts each phase - Confirmed
- [x] Does NOT duplicate Hindsight Integration section details - Confirmed:
  - Hindsight Integration covers technical setup (bank strategy, skepticism, async writes)
  - This section covers conceptual flow (what gets learned, how it compounds)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 95%
- Rationale: Clear conceptual explanation without duplicating existing technical section

## Learnings
- Important to differentiate "what is compounding" (this section) from "how Hindsight is configured" (later section)
- ASCII diagram helps visualize the learning flow across sessions
