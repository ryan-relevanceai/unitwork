# Checkpoint: Minimize human review in verification docs

## Verification Strategy
File content verification via grep.

## Subagents Launched
- None required (documentation changes only)

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
- [x] verify.md template has "AI-Verified (100% Confidence)" section - Confirmed via read
- [x] verify.md template has guidance about when to use Human QA - Confirmed via read
- [x] uw-work.md has "CRITICAL: Minimize human review" instruction - Confirmed via read
- [x] uw-work.md verification template includes AI-Verified section - Confirmed via read
- [x] Checkpoint 5 doc updated as example of corrected approach - Confirmed via read

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 100%
- Rationale: All changes are documentation/template updates verified by reading files.

## Learnings
- Verification philosophy: maximize what AI verifies autonomously, minimize human review
- "There exists" patterns (grep-able) should be AI-verified, not human-reviewed
- Human QA should only include: visual design, subjective UX, complex edge cases

## Human QA Checklist (only if needed)

No human review required - methodology documentation changes verified by agent.
