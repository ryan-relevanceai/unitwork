# Checkpoint: Version bump to 0.6.0

## Verification Strategy
Compare changelog entries against actual changes in branch vs main.

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with 0.6.0 entry - Confirmed via read
- [x] plugin.json version bumped to 0.6.0 - Confirmed via read
- [x] All 15 checkpoints from today documented in changelog:
  - verification-flow.md (checkpoint 1)
  - interview-workflow.md (checkpoint 6)
  - memory-validation.md (checkpoint 10) - NEW AGENT
  - hindsight-reference.md (checkpoint 15)
- [x] Command changes documented (uw-plan, uw-work, uw-review, uw-action-comments)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 100%
- Rationale: Version bump is documentation-only change, verified against commit history

## Learnings
- Checkpoints 1-14 were created but not included in previous version bump
- Adding a new agent (memory-validation) warrants a MINOR version bump (0.5.x → 0.6.0)
- Multiple reference files (verification-flow, interview-workflow, hindsight-reference) are significant additions

## Human QA Checklist
N/A - 100% confidence
