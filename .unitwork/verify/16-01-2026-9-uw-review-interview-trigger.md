# Checkpoint: uw-review.md interview trigger

## Verification Strategy
Verified cross-reference and interview trigger structure via grep.

## Subagents Launched
None - documentation-only change.

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
- [x] Cross-reference to interview-workflow.md added - Confirmed via grep (line 309)
- [x] Interview triggers when fix approach unclear after research - Confirmed via read (line 307)
- [x] Three user options via AskUserQuestion - Confirmed via grep (lines 312-314)
- [x] Gap-detector validation after interview - Confirmed via read (line 316)
- [x] Step numbering updated (4-7 instead of 3-6) - Confirmed via read

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 95%
- Rationale: All required elements present. Interview trigger correctly placed after Context7 research, before implementation. No uncertainty.

## Learnings
- Interview in fix loop provides escape hatches (skip, accept as-is)
- Trigger is conditional: only when research doesn't clarify approach
