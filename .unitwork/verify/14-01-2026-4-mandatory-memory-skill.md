# Checkpoint: SKILL.md Memory as Core Principle

## Verification Strategy
Manual file inspection to confirm new principle and rule added correctly.

## Subagents Launched
- None required (markdown documentation changes only)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 92%
- Rationale: Changes verified by reading file. New principle #3 added to Core Philosophy. New rule 0 added to Memory Rules with CRITICAL callout. Lower confidence (92%) because integration with existing numbered lists required careful attention to maintain consistency.

## Learnings
- Adding to numbered lists requires renumbering subsequent items
- Rule 0 is an effective pattern for "this comes before everything else"

## Human QA Checklist

### Prerequisites
Read the modified file at `plugins/unitwork/skills/unitwork/SKILL.md`

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Core Philosophy has 6 items (was 5)
- [ ] Item 3 is: "NEVER skip memory recall - it's the foundation..."
- [ ] Memory Rules section starts with CRITICAL callout
- [ ] Memory Rules has rule 0: "NEVER skip memory recall at session start"
- [ ] Rule numbering is correct (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- [ ] No duplicate rules or missing content

### Notes
SKILL.md is the core reference for all Unit Work behavior. These changes establish memory as foundational, not optional.
