# Checkpoint: verification-flow.md consolidation

## Verification Strategy
Documentation consolidation with cross-reference updates in source files.

## Subagents Launched
- None (documentation-only changes)

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
Items verified by agent with certainty:
- [x] verification-flow.md created at plugins/unitwork/skills/unitwork/references/verification-flow.md - Confirmed via Read
- [x] Contains "Which Verification Subagent to Use" section - Confirmed via Read (lines 5-43)
- [x] Contains "Confidence Calculation" section - Confirmed via Read (lines 45-60)
- [x] Contains "Self-Correcting Review" section - Confirmed via Read (lines 62-134)
- [x] decision-trees.md updated with cross-reference - Confirmed via Grep (line 118 header exists, content replaced)
- [x] checkpointing.md updated with cross-reference - Confirmed via Grep (line 42 header exists, content replaced)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 95%
- Rationale: All content successfully moved. Cross-references correctly formatted. Documentation-only changes with no code execution risk.

## Learnings
- Consolidation pattern: MOVE content to single source of truth, keep headers in original files with cross-references
- This preserves anchor links while avoiding duplication

## Human QA Checklist (only if needed)
N/A - All verification complete via file reads and grep.
