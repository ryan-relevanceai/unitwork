# Checkpoint: Mandatory Checkpoint Rules

## Verification Strategy
Review the changes to ensure all three additions reinforce the same principle: checkpoints are mandatory, not optional.

## Changes Made
1. Added "When to Checkpoint (Mandatory)" section after Introduction
2. Added rule 8 to Implementation Rules: "Never ask permission to checkpoint"
3. Added CRITICAL callout with explicit prohibitions
4. Strengthened "Handling Feedback" section with CRITICAL callout and explicit steps

## Confidence Assessment
**Confidence:** 95%

**Rationale:**
- Changes are documentation only (no runtime behavior)
- Language is explicit and unambiguous
- Multiple reinforcement points ensure the message is clear
- -5% because effectiveness depends on future sessions following these rules

## Learnings
- Rules that weren't followed need stronger language, not just existence
- "CRITICAL" callouts and explicit "NEVER" statements are more effective than implicit expectations
- Redundancy in documentation (same rule in multiple places) helps reinforce critical behaviors

## Human QA Checklist

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Read uw-work.md and confirm the checkpoint mandate is clear
- [ ] Verify the three locations (intro, rules, feedback) all align
- [ ] Confirm no contradictory language exists elsewhere in the file
