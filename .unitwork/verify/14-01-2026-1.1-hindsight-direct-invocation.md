# Checkpoint: Hindsight Direct Invocation Fix

## Verification Strategy
Grep for BANK_NAME across plugin files to confirm all variable patterns removed.

## Verification Results
```bash
grep -r "BANK_NAME" plugins/unitwork
# Result: No files found
```

All 4 files updated:
- `uw-work.md` - 3 locations
- `uw-bootstrap.md` - 3 locations
- `uw-compound.md` - 1 location
- `uw-plan.md` - 2 locations

## Confidence Assessment
**Confidence:** 98%

**Rationale:**
- Simple search-and-replace pattern
- Grep verification confirms no remaining references
- -2% for not testing actual Hindsight execution

## Learnings
- Follow-up fixes during a work session still need checkpointing
- The checkpoint process applies to ALL changes, not just initial implementation

## Human QA Checklist

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Run `hindsight memory recall "$(basename ...)" "test"` to verify command works
- [ ] Check that no shell variable assignment is needed before Hindsight commands
