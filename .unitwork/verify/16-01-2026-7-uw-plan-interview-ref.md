# Checkpoint: uw-plan.md interview reference

## Verification Strategy
Verified cross-reference and structure via grep and read.

## Subagents Launched
None - documentation-only change.

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
- [x] Cross-reference to interview-workflow.md added - Confirmed via grep (line 155)
- [x] 6 interview rules kept inline (compliance pattern) - Confirmed via read
- [x] Confidence-based depth table added - Confirmed via read (lines 166-174)
- [x] Interview stop condition with gap-detector validation added - Confirmed via read (lines 176-185)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 90%
- Rationale: Interview content successfully extracted and replaced with reference. -10% for potential flow issues that may need tuning during actual use.

## Learnings
- Kept 6 rules inline per intentional duplication pattern (agents skip referenced steps)
- Added concrete stop condition: gap-detector returns no P1/P2 findings
