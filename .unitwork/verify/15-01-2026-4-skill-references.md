# Checkpoint: Update SKILL.md references

## Verification Strategy
Grep for duplicate content and verify references are present.

## Subagents Launched
- None required (documentation-only change)

## AI-Verified (100% Confidence)
Items verified by agent with certainty:
- [x] No inline checkpoint format `checkpoint({unit-number})` in SKILL.md - Confirmed via grep (0 matches)
- [x] Reference to checkpointing.md added - Confirmed via read (line 113)
- [x] Reference to decision-trees.md added - Confirmed via read (line 115)
- [x] Reference to templates/verify.md added - Confirmed via read (line 116)
- [x] Self-correcting review mentioned - Confirmed via read (line 117)

## Confidence Assessment
- Confidence level: 98%
- Rationale: Simple reference replacement. All relative paths are valid from SKILL.md location.

## Learnings
- The section header changed from "Checkpoint Commit Format" to "Checkpoint Protocol" to better reflect the broader scope of the reference
